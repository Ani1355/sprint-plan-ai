---

## 

# Sitemap & global navigation (IA)

Primary layout (desktop): persistent left sidebar + top header + main content canvas + right rail (contextual).

Sidebar items (persistent):

1. Dashboard (PRD §3.2)
2. New Project (CTA + modal/wizard) (PRD §2.1, §3.3)
3. Projects (list/grid)
4. Templates (for Snap Prompt/Theme templates)
5. Settings (account, integrations)
6. Help & Docs (contextual help)

Header: global search (projects & features), quick-create (+), notifications, user avatar menu (profile, billing, sign out).

Right rail (contextual): help tips, AI tips, activity feed when viewing project.

Responsive behavior:

- Mobile: sidebar collapses to bottom tab bar (Dashboard, Projects, New), header condenses (hamburger + search icon).
- Wizard flows are full-screen modals on mobile.

Rationale: persistent sidebar supports quick access and meets PRD requirement for Dashboard/New Project/Settings (PRD §3.2).

# Key user journeys (visual + written)

I. **New user — Signup → Create first project → Export PRD (primary happy path)**

- Signup (Supabase OAuth / email) → Dashboard (empty state) → New Project wizard (3-question questionnaire; autosave) → Trigger AI generation → AI output (Value Proposition, top features) → Feature Generation page (list + auto-MVP selection) → MoSCoW Board (drag/drop adjustments) → Technical Needs → Journey Map → Phase Summary → Export PRD (PDF/DOCX/Shareable link)
- Time goal: complete all above in < 15 minutes for a typical brief.

II. **Returning user — Open project → Revise priorities → Export updated PRD**

- Dashboard → Projects grid → Project Overview → MoSCoW Board → Save → PRD export.

III. **Failure-handling journey — AI error / user abandons**

- AI fails or times out → inline fallback shows editable manual fields + “Try again” + logs → autosave draft → saved in Projects as “Draft” (PRD §2.2).

IV. **Collaboration (assumed)** — Invite team, role-based editing, conflict resolution (assumption; see assumptions/ambiguities).

Visual flowchart (ASCII for implementers) — New Project happy path:

```
[Login/Signup] -> [Dashboard(empty?)] -> [New Project Wizard: Q1,Q2,Q3 (autosave)]
    -> [AI Generation Spinner] -> (success) -> [AI Output: Value Prop (editable)]
    -> [Feature Generation List (15 features; top7 auto-MVP)]
    -> [MoSCoW Board (drag/drop) <-> Feature Item editor]
    -> [Technical Needs (pick auth/integrations/perf)]
    -> [Journey Map (8-step visual, editable)]
    -> [Phase Summary] -> [Export PRD Modal] -> [Download]

```

Decision points & alternates:

- If AI returns low confidence or error → show fallback editable UI + "Regenerate" + "Use suggested defaults".
- If user drags a 'Must' feature to 'Won’t' → show confirmation if it affects auto-MVP; offer "Move to V2 instead?" Hint/undo.

Instrumentation hooks are included at each arrow (see instrumentation section).

# Screen-by-screen detailed design spec

For each screen: purpose (from PRD), components, data inputs/outputs, dynamic states, validation, micro-interactions, accessibility, responsive behavior, acceptance criteria.

> Convention: “AC:” lines near the end of each screen block are acceptance criteria for QA.

4. What makes it magical? (multi-line)
5. Optional advanced: target platforms, sample competitors, initial budget, team size.

**Important behaviors**

- **Autosave** after each field interaction (PRD §3.3 & §2.2). Visual autosave indicator: small “Saved” micro-toaster bottom-left of the field, with timestamp.
- **AI trigger:** After user clicks “Generate” or after all required fields are filled and user confirms, show AI generation modal with spinner & progress.
- **Drafting:** If user abandons, the wizard state is saved as Draft visible in Dashboard.

**Components**

- Progress rail (left small vertical) showing steps + completion %.
- Inline help: example inputs pre-populated and a “Use example” quick-fill.
- Validation inline for empty required fields.

**Validation & errors**

- Who’s it for: must be non-empty.
- AI timeout: show friendly message + fallback manual fields.

**Micro-interactions**

- On typing, soft suggestions drop-down appears for persona mapping (e.g., “Freelance designers”).
- After submit, AI spinner shows progressive messages: "Analyzing problem", "Generating features", "Formatting PRD", with small animated dots (keeps sense of progress).

**Accessibility**

- Each step is a landmark region; step navigation via keyboard.
- Autosave region uses aria-live polite to inform of saved state.

**AC**

- Autosave happens within <3 seconds after user stops typing; saved drafts listed on Dashboard.

**Micro-interactions**

- On selecting "Auto-MVP", animate checkmark and pulse effect on selected features.
- When user edits a feature, show inline save + small undo.

**Accessibility**

- Feature rows are keyboard-navigable; action menu open with Enter.

**AC**

- Top 7 features auto-tagged MVP and can be overridden; updates persist.

---

## 6) MoSCoW Board (PRD §2.1, §3.6)

**Purpose:** Interactive drag-and-drop prioritization with columns Must / Should / Could / Won’t + MVP shortcuts.

**Layout**

- Kanban-style board with four horizontal columns.
- Each column header shows counts, effort totals, and a shortcut toolbar: “Show only MVP”, “Export column”, “Bulk move selected”.
- Feature cards in columns (card design identical to feature list).

**Drag-and-drop interactions**

- Smooth drag: card becomes a "ghost", column highlights, drop animation with snap and micro-vibration.
- Keyboard alternative: select card → focus target column → Move action.

**Edge behaviors**

- If user drags a payment-related feature to "Won’t" but Technical Needs mandate Stripe (contradiction), show a conflict warning modal: "You selected 'Won’t' for a feature tied to an integration you selected in Technical Needs. Resolve or proceed."

**Undo / history**

- Preview panel: AI architecture suggestion summary changes dynamically based on selections (e.g., "If you choose OAuth + Figma integration + High performance → we recommend SSR caching + CDN + RLS policies").

**Dynamic behaviors**

- Selecting integration triggers required permissions and scopes summary (e.g., Figma: Files read/write). Show "Requires approval" tag.
- If user picks OAuth + Stripe, show a small "Impact on time" estimate (e.g., +2 days dev effort).

**Micro-interactions**

- Selecting an integration card expands a details pane with required API keys, scopes, and security notes.

**Accessibility**

# Micro-interactions & motion system

Motion rules:

- Duration small interactions: 120−160ms; larger transitions (modal open, page) 240−280ms.
- Easing: cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.3,1).
- Motion should be minimal to keep perceived speed and meet time-to-PRD goal.

Important micro-interactions:

- Drag-and-drop: ghost card, column highlight, drop ripple, Undo toast.
- AI generation: staged progress messages + subtle progress bar to reduce perceived wait.
- Autosave: small check animation on saved.
- Inline edits: fade in the editor; autosave and provide "Saved" toast.

---

# Accessibility & keyboard / screen reader handling

- All controls must have visible focus rings. Use 3px outline with focus color token.
- Keyboard: every action reachable via keyboard. Drag-and-drop alternatives via selection + move-to controls.
- ARIA:
    - Kanban columns: role="list" and cards role="listitem".
    - Editor toolbar: role="toolbar" with aria-label.
    - Live regions (aria-live="polite") used for autosave, AI status updates, boarding changes.
- Contrast: ensure 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text.
- Motion toggle: user setting for reduced motion; respect OS prefers-reduced-motion.

# Edge cases, validation rules & failure modes (scenario-based)

I’ll list the most important scenarios the PRD mentions and how UI handles them.

1. **User abandons (PRD §2.2)**
    - Behavior: wizard autosaves every field; on inactivity for X minutes, show "Draft saved" banner in Dashboard.
    - UI: visible "Draft" badge and resume CTA.
    - Recovery: versioned drafts with last change timestamp.
2. **AI error or low-confidence**
    - Behavior: show clear error card with reason (timeout, low confidence), provide manual inputs for crucial fields, offer "Try again" and "Use fallback defaults".
    - UI: "AI could not generate X — try again or fill manually" + link to help.
3. **Conflict between Technical Needs and MoSCoW**
    - Behavior: detect contradictions (e.g., chosen integrations required by features marked Won’t), show conflict modal summarizing impacts and offering resolution suggestions.
4. **Invalid credentials or unverified email**
    - Behavior: show inline guidance and CTA to resend verification. Prevent access to project creation until verified (or allow limited trial? — assumption noted).
5. **Large content causing performance lag (many features, huge ERD)**
    - Behavior: pagination and lazy loading; show performance tips ("Split features into epics").
6. **Collaboration conflicts (simultaneous edits)**
    - Behavior: optimistic local edits, server-side merge with conflict resolution UI (live cursors, presence indicators). *Assumption: real-time collaboration is desired — see ambiguities.*
7. **Export errors**
    - Behavior: queue job and email link upon completion; show progress or error and retry.
8. **Third-party integration failures**
    - Behavior: mark integration as failed, show logs and helpful steps to reauthorize.

# Instrumentation & success metric tracking (ties to PRD §1.4 & §9)

Events to capture (analytics / product analytics):

- `SignupCompleted`
- `ProjectCreated` with timestamps
- `TimeToPRD_Start` and `TimeToPRD_Complete` (calculate time delta)
- `AI_Generation_Start`, `AI_Generation_Success`, `AI_Generation_Failure` (with failure kind)
- `FeatureAutoMVP_Applied`, `FeatureMoved_MoSCoW`
- `Export_PRD` with format
- `RepeatProject_Created` (identify returning users)
- `Wizard_Abandon` (record progress %)

Key derived metrics:

- Median TimeToPRD (goal < 15m)
- Completion Rate (projects started vs completed)
- Repeat Usage (% users with >1 project)

Logging considerations:

- Capture latencies from AI and DB for diagnosing slow/failed steps.
- Track UI interaction events to identify bottlenecks (drag count, regenerate clicks).

# Design handoff & acceptance artifacts

Deliver to engineering:

1. Figma file with all screens & components (light, dark, glassmorphic variants).
2. Design tokens export (Tailwind config + JSON tokens).
3. Interaction spec doc (micro-interactions, timings).
4. Accessibility checklist with ARIA attributes and keyboard flows.
5. Page-level acceptance criteria (ACs included per screen).
6. Export templates: PDF/DOCX styling reference (first page mock).
7. Sample AI prompts used to generate content (for the backend agent).

QA acceptance criteria (examples)

- New Project completes end-to-end in < 15 minutes for a typical input.
- Autosave triggers within 3s of typing pause and persists to DB.
- Drag-and-drop and keyboard move equivalents function and Undo works.
- Exports produce readable PDF/DOCX with theme applied.

# Ambiguities, missing details, & explicit assumptions

I identified key missing items in the PRD and made reasonable assumptions so the team can proceed. Flag these as decisions to confirm:

1. **User roles & real-time collaboration**
    - PRD mentions “startup product teams” but does not define roles or permissions (owner/editor/viewer). **Assumption:** basic roles: Owner, Editor, Viewer. Real-time presence/collaboration is desirable but optional — design includes presence indicators and optimistic UI to support later upgrade.
2. **Limits and quotas**
    - No limits on number of projects, file sizes, feature counts or export quotas. **Assumption:** soft limits enforced via plan tiers with clear message in Settings.
3. **Integration specifics**
    - PRD references Figma, Stripe, OAuth but not scope details. **Assumption:** standard scopes: Figma read/write files, Stripe payments basic; UI shows required scopes on selection; engineering to confirm exact API requirements.
4. **Authentication flows**
    - MFA and enterprise SSO are mentioned only implicitly. **Assumption:** support OAuth + email/password + optional SSO (enterprise) later.
5. **Collaboration conflict strategy**
    - PRD does not specify last-write-wins vs merge. **Assumption:** use operational transform for text areas where possible; otherwise present conflict UI.
6. **Export brand styling**
    - PRD lists theme options but not brand assets or customer logos. **Assumption:** user can upload brand asset in settings; default branding available.
7. **Localization & RTL**
    - No language requirements specified. **Assumption:** English first; design supports translation-ready copy and RTL layout later.
8. **Offline support**
    - PRD does not mention offline mode. **Assumption:** not required for v1.
9. **Data retention & privacy**
    - Not covered. **Assumption:** follow standard policies; store AI inputs for improving suggestions only with user opt-in.
10. **Pricing & Billing UX**
    - PRD references integrations and deployment but not billing model. **Assumption:** basic free tier + paid tiers; billing UI needs to be built in Settings.

List these assumptions explicitly to stakeholders and convert each to an RFD (required for development) or decision ticket.

# Design rationales & mapping to PRD paragraphs

- Persistent left sidebar + Dashboard / New Project / Settings: **directly from PRD §3.2**.
- New Project questionnaire with autosave + AI trigger: **PRD §2.1 & §3.3**; autosave is required for "User abandons" fallback (§2.2).
- Auto-select top 7 MVP features and MoSCoW board: **PRD §2.1 (Feature Generation)** and **§3.6 (MoSCoW Board)**.
- Technical Needs page that triggers AI architecture suggestion: **PRD §2.1 (Technical Needs)** and **§3.7**.
- Journey Map with 8 steps and inline edit: **PRD §2.1 (AI Output)** and **§3.8**.
- Design system generation (Snap Prompt) + themes: **PRD §4.1 & §4.2**.
- DB schema generation and RLS snippet: **PRD §5**.
- PRD export + build prompts: **PRD §6 & §7**.
- Security: RLS & auth enforced as per **PRD §8.2** — UI surfaces RLS snippet and warns developers.

# Example scenario walkthroughs (step-by-step)

### A. Happy path — Create project in ≈10 minutes

1. User signs up via Google (30s).
2. Dashboard empty → clicks "Create Your First Project" (5s).
3. Fills three fields (3 min) — autosave triggered.
4. Clicks "Generate" → AI produces value prop + 15 features (30s).
5. Reviews features, confirms top 7 for MVP (2 min).
6. Drag/Drop to MoSCoW (1 min).
7. Selects OAuth + Figma in Technical Needs (30s) → preview architecture.
8. Export PRD as PDF (30s). Total ~8–10 minutes.

### B. AI timeout or low-confidence

1. AI returns error after 30s: UI shows message "AI couldn't generate a confident result."
2. UI presents:
    - Last input retained in editor (editable).
    - Quick "Use default outputs" that pre-fills a minimal template.
    - “Try again” with suggested context additions.
3. User either edits manually or retries.

### C. Abandonment & recovery

1. User starts wizard and leaves (network disconnect or closes tab).
2. After autosave, draft appears on Dashboard with timestamp and “Resume” button.
3. On returning, user resumes from same step. Draft history available.

---

# Implementation notes for engineering

- Use optimistic UI for drag actions; server reconciliation with last-action ordering.
- Autosave: debounce 800ms; show "Saving…" then "Saved • timestamp".
- AI call orchestration: staged progress reporting (backend must return stage metadata when available).
- Accessibility: use existing libraries for keyboard drag-and-drop fallback (aria-dnd patterns).
- Integrations: make integration connectors modular and lazy-loaded to avoid initial bundle bloat.
- Exporting: server-side rendering for PDF/DOCX to ensure consistent styling.

---

# Deliverables checklist for final handoff

Design deliverables to hand to the dev team:

- Figma file (all screens + variants)
- Component library with tokens exported (Tailwind-ready)
- Interaction spec (micro-interactions + motion tokens)
- Accessibility checklist & ARIA mappings
- Copy file with microcopy & error messages
- Analytics event list + telemetry schema
- QA checklist with acceptance criteria per screen
- Export templates for PDF/DOCX

---

# Quick reference: Sample microcopy (error & helper texts)

- Autosave success: “Saved • 45s ago”
- AI start: “AI is generating your product vision…”
- AI timeout error: “We couldn’t generate results right now. Try again or edit manually.”
- Feature conflict modal: “This feature requires an integration you marked as Won’t. Keep it in Won’t or move to Should? [Keep Won’t] [Move to Should]”
- Export ready: “Your PRD is ready. Download PDF or copy shareable link

# Database Schema Design – AI-Assisted Product Strategy & PRD Generator

This document defines the database schema for the application, aligned with the PRD and UI/UX plan. It outlines tables, relationships, constraints, and security considerations to support multi-tenant usage and enforce data integrity.

---

## **1. Design Principles**

- **Multi-tenant:** Each record is linked to a project and an owner (user).
- **Security-first:** Row-Level Security (RLS) enforced on all tables.
- **Soft Deletes:** All major tables include a `deleted_at` column.
- **Auditability:** Activity logs capture all important changes.
- **Extensibility:** JSONB fields used for metadata where flexibility is required.

---

## **2. Core Entities & Relationships**

### **Users & Profiles**

- **Profiles** table extends `auth.users` with name, avatar, etc.
- Each profile owns zero or more **projects**.

### **Projects**

- Central entity representing a single product being planned.
- Contains title, description, status (draft, active, archived).
- Related entities:
    - **Questionnaire Responses** (product vision capture)
    - **Features** (AI-generated + prioritized)
    - **Technical Requirements** (auth, integrations, performance priorities)
    - **Journey Map** (8-screen flow generated by AI)
    - **PRD Documents** (versions of generated PRDs)
    - **Attachments** (files or assets)
    - **Activity Logs** (audit trail)

### **Questionnaire Responses**

- Stores answers to: Who’s it for? What problem does it solve? What makes it magical?
- Supports auto-save for draft states.

### **Features**

- Each feature has title, description, priority (MoSCoW: Must, Should, Could, Won’t).
- Order index for drag-and-drop sorting.
- Boolean flag for MVP inclusion.

### **Technical Requirements**

- Stores requirement type (auth, integration, infra) + selected value (e.g., OAuth, Stripe, High performance).
- Links back to project.

### **Journey Maps**

- Stores steps in JSON array with step order, name, and editable description.
- Represents the 8-screen user journey generated by AI.

### **PRD Documents**

- Version-controlled, stores generated PRD content as JSON.
- Used for export (PDF, DOCX, Web link).

### **Attachments**

- Stores metadata for uploaded files (path, size, type).
- Used for Snap Prompt uploads or references.

### **Activity Logs**

- Captures actor, project, action type, payload (JSON).
- Used for audit trails and analytics.

---

## **3. Relationships**

- **profiles.id → projects.owner_id** (one-to-many)
- **projects.id → questionnaire_responses.project_id** (one-to-many)
- **projects.id → features.project_id** (one-to-many)
- **projects.id → technical_requirements.project_id** (one-to-many)
- **projects.id → journey_maps.project_id** (one-to-one per version)
- **projects.id → prd_documents.project_id** (one-to-many, versioned)
- **projects.id → attachments.project_id** (one-to-many)
- **projects.id → activity_logs.project_id** (one-to-many)

---

## **4. Row-Level Security (RLS)**

- **Enabled for all tables.**
- Policies enforce that `auth.uid() = owner_id` (or linked project’s owner) for SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.
- Service role policies explicitly defined for background tasks.

---

## **5. Soft Deletes & Audit Trail**

- `deleted_at` column present in all core tables (projects, features, questionnaire_responses, etc.).
- Queries exclude soft-deleted records by default.
- **Activity Logs** table records each change (who, what, when).

---

## **6. Data Protection & Validation**

- Input validation performed at Edge Function layer.
- File uploads restricted by MIME type, size, and scanned for malware.
- Sensitive data encrypted (if required) using pgcrypto.
- Metadata stripped from uploads for privacy.

---

## **7. Future Extensions**

- **Collaboration support:** Shared projects via join table `project_members`.
- **Commenting:** Threaded comments on features/journey steps.
- **Analytics:** Table for PRD export events and usage metrics.

---

## **8. Schema Summary (Entity List)**

| Entity | Key Fields | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **profiles** | id, full_name, avatar_url | User profile data |
| **projects** | id, owner_id, title, status | Central project entity |
| **questionnaire_responses** | question, answer | Captures product vision |
| **features** | title, description, priority, mvp | AI-generated features |
| **technical_requirements** | requirement_type, value | Captures technical needs |
| **journey_maps** | steps (JSON) | 8-screen flow mapping |
| **prd_documents** | content (JSON), version | PRD versions & exports |
| **attachments** | storage_path, mime_type | Uploaded assets |
| **activity_logs** | actor_id, action, payload | Audit history |

---

**Outcome:** This schema fully supports the PRD workflow — from capturing product vision, generating features, prioritizing with MoSCoW, defining technical requirements, visualizing journey maps, generating PRDs, and exporting deliverables — with robust multi-tenant security, auditability, and extensibility.
